# OT MONITORING DASHBOARD
This project aims to provide Babco’s Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure and security team with a monitoring tool (dashboard); this tool will allow the team, with one single click of a button, to check the status of a group of assets that reside in the process network.

From the studies and comparisons we did, it was very clear that the monitoring tools and systems available did not support enough information for a company as large as Babco, and if a system was to be developed to track such sensitive assets, it would need to be a lot more dense, easy to use and understand, and mainly replace the old, manual way of having the infrastructure and security team monitor every system separately.

Therefore, we developed an Operational Technology monitoring tool, we named it Babco, using Visual Studio as a development environment, while taking users and management’s feedback into consideration to develop and improve the functionality of the system, the user interface and the main dashboard.
